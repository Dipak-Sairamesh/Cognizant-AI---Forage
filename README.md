# Cognizant-AI---Forage

Cognizant Artificial Intelligence Job Simulation on Forage - June 2024

I just completed Cognizant's Artificial Intelligence on Forage. 

* Completed a job simulation focused on AI for Cognizant’s Data Science team.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis using Python and Google Colab for one of Cognizant’s technology-led clients, Gala Groceries.
* Prepare a Python module that contains code to train a model and output the performance metrics for the Machine Learning engineering team.
* Communicated findings and analysis in the form of a PowerPoint slide to present the results back to the business.

I recently participated in Cognizant’s job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a Data Science team, to work with Python and Google Colab in a realistic context and to produce, evaluate and improve a production machine learning model. Through this program I realized that I really enjoy researching and improving the performance of machine learning models.
